## usage ##

```r
npm install all the modules shown in package.json
node .
log in to ur account with token or credentials

type /file to upload a file with filepath
press enter on a chat to reload the chat messages
connected to websocket so it doesnt send a million requests per second
```

## note ##
PLEASE MAKE A NODE MODULES WITH PROPER TERMINAL FUNCTIONS SO I CAN MAKE THIS PROPERLY
